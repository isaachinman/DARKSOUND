# DARKSOUND

<p>DARKSOUND is an experimental piece of net art shining a light on the dark shadows of the hours of night - inviting your senses of curiosity and adventure to roam free within the walls of its mysterious tenement building, immersed in the sights and sounds.</p>
<p>Created by students at Edinburgh College of Art, DARKSOUND brings together photography, field recording, recorded conversation, music composition, graphic design & web design to represent different public experiences of night routines and lifestyles. <a href="http://darksound-interactive.com/">The project can be found here.</a></p>
